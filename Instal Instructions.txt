Welcome to the Port In The Storm. Here are the basic instructions on how to properly install the amends files. You should also have found an image file which visually shows you how to install the amends. These are both offering the same information, just in different ways.


1: Install the Settings Files


You will find 3 Settings Files:

Port Point Buy.xml
Point Priority.xml
Port STT.xml


Move all 3 of these files into Chummerâ€™s Settings folder in the location where you installed Chummer. You may need to launch Chummer for the first time for this folder to appear.


2: Instal Amends files

In the same location where you found the Settings folder, look for a folder called customdata


From this download, move the entire Port House Rules folder, including the folder itself, into the customdata folder.




Launch Chummer and check to confirm everything is working correctly by selecting any of the Port Settings files when making a new character.


Have fun!

Oh yeah, after all of that, feel free to delete this file, and everything else you haven't moved.
